## How it works?
1. Run simulation.
2. Console says that system is active, but it's not armed. To do that, click left black button, then type password, which is "1234". Now it's armed.
3. To start an alarm, click white round sensor, then move blue dot. Console will print, that there is 20 seconds until it will start alarm. To deactivate, click right black button, and type password "1234". Now it's deactivated and unarmed.
4. To activate the system again, go back to step number 2.
